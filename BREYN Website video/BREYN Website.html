<p>SEAMLESS</p>
<p>THAT MATTERS</p>
<p>INTEROPABILITY </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Why now </p>
<p>The age of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) is here. Companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink and Synchron are advancing invasive BCIs for medical use, but we aim to lead the non-invasive, consumer-level BCI market. In 2025, gaming and multimedia industries will demand wearable, non-invasive BCIs, and our technology is a perfect match. Recent breakthroughs in chip miniaturization by Nvidia and Google enable offline functionality, solving latency issues. We are pioneers in creating high-performance, wearable BCIs for everyday use.</p>
<p>We stand out through seamless integration and versatility, offering plug-and-play solutions for applications ranging from smart homes to emerging markets and custom apps. With quarterly hardware innovations and AI-driven native applications, BREYN ensures continuous improvement. BREYN is designed to work anywhere, anytime, making it the ideal consumer BCI solution.</p>
<p>Why us</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>THE CHALLENGE</p>
<p>Current BCls units are low-quality devices with poor signal communication (noise interferences, latency, etc.) and lack the necessary scalability to link brainwaves across multiple applications and devices.</p>
<p>The current BCI applications and hardware are struggling to reach a considerable consumer level adoption and a high-quality experience. </p>
<p>VR environments/games need a new dimension of interactivity. Our BCI allows the player’s feelings, emotions, and unique brain activity to interact, shape, and enhance any VR/AR experience.</p>
<p>Factor 1</p>
<p>Factor 2</p>
<p><b>This is mainly because of two factors:</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>We aim to solve the above two points by combining the Al powered applications with portable high-quality BCI interfaces to offer a “plug and play” experience where the users experience the “brain to machine” interaction as naturally and effortlessly as possible.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>OUR SOLUTION</p>
<p>The BREYN BCI is positioned to revolutionize the way we approach data security and identity verification. Through brainwave encryption and a truth verification mechanism, it offers a unique, reliable, and secure solution suited for high-stakes applications such as homeland security and data protection.</p>
<p>Reliability</p>
<p>A portable high-definition Bluetooth-compatible BCI (BrainComputer Interface) fits a headband and can be integrated with any existing VR headset (Oculus, PSVR, etc.) or used as a standalone device on your Phone, Computer and gaming console (PS5 - Xbox, and more).</p>
<p>Seamless Interoperability </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>BREYN POWER.</p>
<p>BREYN connects your brain seamlessly across multiple devices and apps, enabling mind-controlled homes, lighting, and even “mind-matching” to find your soul mate. It integrates with VR, AR, graphic design software, and digital audio workstations, offering unparalleled mind-to-machine interaction.</p>
<p>Master your mind’s full potential—awake or asleep—with our all-encompassing BCI technology.</p>
<p>BREYN creates a personalized, immersive gaming experience, allowing users to control environments and objects through their thoughts and emotions. It’s a breakthrough for the gaming industry, comparable to the introduction of the joystick in 1967.</p>
<p>Scalability: The Universal BCI </p>
<p>VR &amp; AR: </p>
<p>Play Games with Your Thoughts</p>
<p>Our BCI focuses on all the main brainwaves produced during waking and sleeping states.</p>
<p>BREYN introduces brainwave-based encryption, making your brain the algorithm for generating secure, uncrackable encryption keys. Compatible with Bluetooth devices, it’s ideal for public and private sectors. BREYN also supports lie detection for law enforcement, homeland security, and border control, providing portable, easy-to-deploy solutions without the need for bulky equipment.</p>
<p>Security: BREYN Is the Key</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Gamma waves are the fastest brain waves, linked to heightened alertness, happiness, better concentration, and higher IQ. They support higher brain functions like cognition, memory, and increased awareness during meditation. Studies by the Princeton Neuroscience Institute highlight the importance of healthy Gamma wave activity. Our BCI is designed to monitor the full range of Gamma waves for optimal brain performance.</p>
<p>GAMMA WAVES</p>
<p>One of the unique applications of our BCls is the training of Gamma Waves in the human brain.</p>
<p>Gamma waves enhance cognition, memory, attention, and mindfulness while aiding in treating conditions like Alzheimer’s, ADHD, depression, and epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>GAMMA (35 HZ): </b>CONCENTRATION</p>
<p><b>Beta (12-35 Hz): </b>Dominant during anxiety, active states, and external attention</p>
<p><b>Alpha (8-12 Hz):</b> Very relaxed state with passive attention</p>
<p><b>Theta (4-8 Hz):</b> Deep relaxation and inward focus</p>
<p><b>Delta (0.5-4 Hz):</b> Associated with REM sleep and deep rest</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>We provide dedicated apps for all your needs.</p>
